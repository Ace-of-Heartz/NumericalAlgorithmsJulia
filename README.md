# Numerical algorithms implemented in Julia

## Algorithms
### Currently implemented:
- Fitting a straight line in 2 dimensions using the method of least squares 
- Fitting a plane in 3 dimensions using the method of least squares 
- Savitzky-Golay filter for 2 dimensional values
- Approximation of parametric curves using differential equation solvers 
  - Chase (Chase.jl): An object is constantly moving in the direction of another object with a constant speed value.
  - Pull (Pull.jl): An object is being pulled or pushed by another moving object through a solid, inflexible beam with $d$ length that is attached to the pulled/pushed object in question.
